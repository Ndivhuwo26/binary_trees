A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This structure is hierarchical, meaning it has a topmost node called the root. Binary trees are commonly used in various applications, such as search algorithms, sorting algorithms, and for representing hierarchical data.

Key Characteristics:
Root: The topmost node in the tree.
Node: Each element in the tree containing a value, a reference to the left child, and a reference to the right child.
Edge: The connection between a parent node and a child node.
Leaf: A node that does not have any children.
Subtree: A tree consisting of a node and its descendants.
Types of Binary Trees:
Full Binary Tree: Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
Perfect Binary Tree: All internal nodes have two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
Complete Binary Tree: All levels are fully filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.
Balanced Binary Tree: The height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where the left child contains only nodes with values less than the parent node, and the right child only nodes with values greater than the parent node.
Binary trees are fundamental in computer science and provide the basis for more complex data structures and algorithms, such as binary heaps, AVL trees, and B-trees.
